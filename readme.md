## About This Series

Made your way through Laravel 5 Fundamentals, and now feel ready to take the next step? Let's build our first little app together, one step at a time! We'll tackle a small, but useful tool that I require for Laracasts. This will give us some nice seeds to discuss authentication, forms, Eloquent, and more!

The fundamentals of Laravel

----------------------------------

# Episode 1 - What We'll Build 
Published on February 16th, 2015 • Intermediate

Before we dive into the code, let me give you a quick tour of what we're planning to build. Don't worry; it's nothing too complex.

# Episode 2 - Preparing a Custom Domain  
Published on February 16th, 2015 • Intermediate

We'll be using Vagrant and Laravel Homestead in this series. Let's begin by preparing a custom domain for our local app.

# Episode 3 - Initial Routing and View Setup  
Published on February 17th, 2015 • Intermediate

Next, let's work on some basic routing for our app, while also prepping our main master page.

# Episode 4 - Database Setup and Authentication  
Published on February 17th, 2015 • Intermediate

An SQLite database should suffice for this little project. So let's setup the necessary configuration for this. Additionally, we'll ensure that the authentication layer for our app is working, as expected.

# Episode 5 - Notices  
Published on February 18th, 2015 • Intermediate

Yay - we get to start building the form that allows users of our app to prepare and deliver DMCA take-down requests to these various content providers.

# Episode 6 - A Touch of Styling  
Published on February 18th, 2015 • Intermediate

We're not overly interested in design for this application, but, nonetheless, even though we're developers, let's at least take a moment or two to tweak the design, while setting up Laravel Elixir.

# Episode 7 - Content Providers  
Published on February 19th, 2015 • Intermediate

If the plan is to fire off these emails to various content providers (like YouTube, Vimeo, and Viddler), then we should go ahead and set up the appropriate table and Eloquent model.

# Episode 8 - User Confirmation  
Published on February 20th, 2015 • Intermediate

We're almost ready to deliver these dang DMCA requests! But, first, I want to give the user the ability to preview the email that will be sent. This way, should they need to, they can modify the message, as needed.

# Episode 9 - Storing DMCA Notices  
Published on February 23rd, 2015 • Intermediate

So we have all the information that we require from the user. Let's now persist this data to a new "notices" table, so that the user may track the take-downs that they've fired off.

# Episode 10 - Delivery  
Published on February 24th, 2015 • Intermediate

Well, it's time to actually fire off these notifications to YouTube, Vimeo, etc. Let's review our options in this episode.

#Episode 11 - Hooking into Mandrill  
Published on February 26th, 2015 • Intermediate

One wonderful thing about Laravel is that it includes a number of drivers for its various components. Mail is no different. Let's use this lesson to setup Mandrill for our application. It's so easy!

#Episode 12 - Tracking Notices  
Published on February 27th, 2015 • Intermediate

So far, the main "notices" overview page is simply returning JSON. We clearly don't want that, so let's provide a nice table display, sot that the user may track all of the take-down requests that they've filed.

#Episode 12 - Everything Else 
Published on March 2nd, 2015 • Intermediate

It's the final episode of this series, so we have a bunch to do! We'll begin by working on various loose ends. Toward the end of the episode, we'll take a break from our PHP, and write some JavaScript to allow for AJAX form submissions and such.

Thanks for coming along for the ride! Feel free to take it from here, and add more functionality.
